- 👋 Hi, I’m @ethan-cope! An electrical engineer, multi-instrumentalist, and internet native.
- 👀 I’m interested in a ton of totally unrelated topics, like open-source software, audio electronics, physical entertainment media, and more!
- 🌱 I’m currently learning the ins and outs of Linux and analog signal processing.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on any songs that need some harmonica!
- 📫 How to reach me: Email works fine!
